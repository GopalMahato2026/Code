## Abstract Classes & Interfaces
"""
What is an Abstract Class?
An abstract class is like a blueprint.
it can't be directly used to create objects, but other classes can inherit from it and must implement certain methods.
Why do we use it?
-To define a common structure for all child classes.
-To force child classes to implement some methods.
-Great for working with polymorphism in big projects.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# So, ABC means abstract base class
# @abstractmethod means Marks a method that overridden in child classes
